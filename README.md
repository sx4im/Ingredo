## ⚙️ Configuration

Before using Recipe AI, you'll need to add your API key in the `config.js` file:

1. Create an account at [our API provider]
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Open `config.js` and replace the placeholder with your API key:

```javascript
// config.js
const CONFIG = {
  API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  API_ENDPOINT: "https://api.example.com/v1/recipes",
  IMAGE_DETECTION_ENDPOINT: "https://api.example.com/v1/detect"
};
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Never commit your API key to public repositories!

## 🧩 How It Works

Recipe AI uses a combination of technologies to deliver an amazing cooking experience:

1. 📸 **Image Upload & Detection** (`imageDetection.js`)
   - Uses computer vision to identify ingredients in uploaded images

2. 🍽️ **Recipe Generation** (`recipeGenerator.js`) 
   - Processes identified ingredients and generates suitable recipes

3. 💾 **Storage** (`storage.js`)
   - Manages saving and retrieving favorite recipes

4. 🔄 **Application Logic** (`app.js`)
   - Coordinates all components and handles user interaction
